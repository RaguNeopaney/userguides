        <p>Tangerines is a web page with a score on it and the game underneath. The game will have five pots at the bottom of the column and 5 rows of leaves making a 5x5 grid. The objective of the game will be to flip over the leaves and avoid flipping over a leaf that had a exploding(red) tangerine behind it. There will be clues on each of the pots and end of the rows that tell you the point value of the row and how many exploding tangerines are on each row. When flipping over a leaf (one square of the 5x5 grid) you will either get a red, green, orange, or gold tangerine. Red tangerines end the game. Green tangerines are worth 1, orange tangerines are worth 2 and gold tangerines will be worth 3. The points will be multiplicative, as every time you get a tangerine, it will be multiplied to your current score. </p>

        <h2 id="about-the-game">About the game</h2>
        <p>The goal of Tangerines is to determine the location of orange, gold, and red tangerines on the game board. The player uses the hints provided by the numbers on the sides of the board to deduce which tiles have the desired value and which are bombs. The player scores points by flipping the correct tiles, with the point value multiplied by the number on the tile. The objective is to score as many points as possible by avoiding the bombs and uncovering the valuable tiles. To flip a leaf, click on it.  
            In Tangerines, players can use the memo function to keep track of the leaves they have already flipped and the value they have deduced for each tile. The memo function allows players to mark tiles with different symbols or colors, such as a flag for exploding tangerines or an X for tiles that have already been flipped.
